# Design Spec: Daily Digest Generalization
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Scope:** Modify existing `ai-daily` skill to support any enterprise department, not just AI domain

---

## Problem Statement

The current `ai-daily` skill is hardcoded for AI industry news. The goal is to make it domain-agnostic — serving any enterprise department (marketing, finance, product, legal, etc.) by reading the department's Feishu knowledge base and group chat to understand their specific context and interests.

---

## Approved Approach: Feishu-Driven Department Profile + Daily Group Chat Signals

The profile is not manually filled. Instead:
1. **One-time initialization**: Agent reads Feishu KB to generate an initial `dept-profile.yaml`
2. **Daily incremental update**: Agent reads the department's designated Feishu group chat each day, extracts signals, and updates the profile
3. **Daily digest generation**: Driven by the updated profile

---

## Required Feishu MCP Capabilities

The skill relies on these logical capabilities. The table maps them to known tool names in the current environment; if tool names differ, implement against the logical capability:

| Logical Capability | Known Tool Name(s) | Used For | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| List KB wiki nodes | `feishu_wiki_space_node` | KB init: enumerate pages | Required |
| Read KB document content | `feishu_fetch_doc` | KB init: read page content | Required |
| Read group chat messages (with time range) | `feishu_im_user_get_messages` | Daily signal collection | Required |
| Read message reactions | *(no direct equivalent exposed)* | Signal scoring boost | Optional |

**Note on `get_message_reactions`**: If no reaction-reading tool is available, treat all qualifying messages equally (remove the "1 message + ≥1 reaction" signal path; use only the ≥2 messages threshold).

---

## Profile State Machine

`dept-profile.yaml` moves through these states. Step 0 reads the current state and routes accordingly:

```
uninitialized
    ↓ KB read succeeds
awaiting_group_id          ← feishu_group_id is empty; user must provide it
    ↓ user runs: /ai-daily set-group <chat_id>
active                     ← normal daily operation
    ↓ MCP failure or degraded KB
degraded                   ← daily digest continues; group chat signals skipped
    ↓ MCP recovers
active
```

`feishu_group_id` is **never auto-written** from within a single execution flow. It is set explicitly via the `/ai-daily set-group <chat_id>` command, which patches the profile and transitions state from `awaiting_group_id` → `active`.

---

## Architecture

### Execution Paths

**Path A — Profile Initialization (state: `uninitialized` → `awaiting_group_id`)**
```
Feishu KB (project docs + OKRs + historical reports)
    ↓ feishu_wiki_space_node → feishu_fetch_doc
    ↓ default: 2 levels deep, up to 20 pages, skip >50KB
    ↓ (these are configurable defaults, not hard limits — see dept-profile.yaml)
AI analysis → generate config/dept-profile.yaml
    ↓
state: awaiting_group_id — prompt user to run /ai-daily set-group <chat_id>
```

**Path B — Daily Digest Generation (state: `active` or `degraded`)**
```
Read Feishu group chat (today's messages, time-bounded pagination)
    ↓
Extract signals → update dept-profile.yaml incrementally
    ↓
Build search strategy from updated profile
    ↓
Parallel collection (WebSearch + WebFetch)
    ↓
Filter → generate structured JSON (includes digest_meta.warnings[])
    ↓
Render HTML → start feedback server
    ↓
Extract today's summary → append to profile history
```

**Path C — Control Commands**

All commands patch `dept-profile.yaml` directly and may trigger a state transition:

| Command | Fields Modified | State Transition | Error Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/ai-daily set-group <chat_id>` | `department.feishu_group_id` | `awaiting_group_id` → `active` | Error if `chat_id` empty or invalid format |
| `/ai-daily set-domain <primary_domain>` | `department.primary_domain` | any → same (no state change) | Error if value not in controlled vocab; suggest closest match |
| `/ai-daily set-context <freeform_text>` | `department.freeform_context` | any → same | None; accepts any string |
| `/ai-daily refresh-profile` | Rebuilds full `dept-profile.yaml` from KB | `feishu_group_id` set → `active`; not set → `awaiting_group_id` | Preserves `feishu_group_id` if already set |

Notes:
- `set-domain` and `set-context` are valid in any state, including `degraded`
- `refresh-profile` re-runs Path A; existing `feishu_group_id` is carried over so users don't need to re-run `set-group`
- `secondary_domains` are not directly settable via command; they are inferred during KB init or `refresh-profile`, and can be manually edited in `dept-profile.yaml`

**`refresh-profile` field semantics** — rebuild static profile, preserve dynamic behavior data:

| Field Group | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `department.name`, `primary_domain`, `secondary_domains`, `freeform_context`, `industry` | **Rebuilt** from KB |
| `department.feishu_group_id` | **Preserved** if already set |
| `sources.direct`, `sources.search_queries` | **Rebuilt** from KB (domain inference) |
| `kb_init.*` | **Rebuilt** (new init run) |
| `tracking.*` | **Preserved** — contains accumulated signal data |
| `topic_weights` | **Preserved**; new topics from KB are merged in at `new_topic_initial_weight` |
| `history` | **Preserved** |
| `signal_rules` | **Preserved** (user may have tuned values) |
| `runtime` | **Reset** `last_signal_update` to null |

---

## dept-profile.yaml Schema

File location: `config/dept-profile.yaml` (replaces `config/profile.yaml`).

**Migration**: On first run, if `config/profile.yaml` exists but `config/dept-profile.yaml` does not, the agent reads the old file, maps relevant fields into the new schema, and writes `schema_version: 1`. The old file is renamed to `config/profile.yaml.bak`.

Fields dropped during migration (not carried forward): `server.port`, `server.timeout_hours`, `role`, `role_context`, `topics`, `exclude_topics`, `daily.*`. Server configuration continues to use SKILL.md defaults (port 17890, timeout 2h). Users who customized these values should note them before migration.

```yaml

  last_step1_result: "full_success"                   # full_success | partial_fetch | business_empty | transport_auth_failure
```

### Warning Structure

`digest_meta.warnings[]` entries in the JSON payload use this schema:

```json
{
  "code": "GROUP_CHAT_PARTIAL_FETCH",
  "message": "Pagination incomplete; processed 312 of estimated 800+ messages.",
  "severity": "warning"
}
```

Defined warning codes:

| Code | Severity | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `GROUP_CHAT_TRANSPORT_FAILURE` | `error` | `feishu_im_user_get_messages` returns transport/auth error |
| `GROUP_CHAT_PARTIAL_FETCH` | `warning` | Pagination incomplete but ≥1 page succeeded |
| `KB_INIT_PAGES_SKIPPED` | `info` | Some KB pages skipped during init (size/permission) |
| `PROFILE_DEGRADED` | `warning` | Emitted on every digest run while profile is in `degraded` state (not just on transition) |

### Controlled Domain Vocabulary

`primary_domain` must be one of:
`ai`, `product`, `engineering`, `marketing`, `finance`, `legal`, `operations`, `sales`, `research`, `hr`, `data`, `design`, `growth`, `security`, `strategy`, `customer_success`, `bd`, `general`

`secondary_domains` should prefer controlled vocab values; freeform strings are allowed only when no controlled tag fits. `freeform_context` accepts free text and is passed directly to the AI as additional context when building the search strategy.

---

## Revised Execution Flow

### Step 0: Profile Check + State Routing

| State | Action |
|---|---|
| File missing, no legacy | Trigger KB init (Path A) |
| File missing, legacy exists | Migrate from `profile.yaml`, state → `awaiting_group_id` |
| `uninitialized` | Trigger KB init (Path A) |
| `awaiting_group_id` | Prompt user to run `/ai-daily set-group <chat_id>`; exit |
| `active` | Continue to Step 1 |
| `degraded` | Skip Step 1; continue from Step 2 using current profile |

### Step 1 (NEW): Read Group Chat Signals

**Message fetching**: Paginate `feishu_im_user_get_messages` from UTC+8 00:00 today to current time. Continue paginating until either the start of day is reached or 1000 messages total are fetched, whichever comes first. Summarize/compress before analysis if >200 messages retrieved.

**Signal extraction rules** (all thresholds from `signal_rules.*`):
- **Topic boost**: topic mentioned in ≥ `topic_boost_threshold` messages → `weight += daily_boost` (capped at 1.0)
- **Entity signal**: company/product/market name in ≥ `entity_threshold` messages → add/update `tracking` entry
- **New topic**: not in profile, mentioned ≥ `new_topic_threshold` times → add with `new_topic_initial_weight`
- **Noise filter**: single mentions are ignored

**After extraction**:
- Apply decay to all topics not signaled today: `weight *= daily_decay` (floor `weight_floor`)
- Prune tracking entries where `last_signal` > `prune_days` ago AND `score` < `prune_score_threshold` AND `signal_count_7d == 0` (if `prune_require_zero_7d` is true)
- Write incremental changes back to `dept-profile.yaml`

**On Step 1 failure classification**:

| Failure Type | Condition | State Transition |
|---|---|---|
| Transport / auth failure | MCP call returns error, timeout, or permission denied | → `degraded` |
| Business-empty | Call succeeds but 0 messages returned (quiet day) | stays `active`; apply decay only |
| Partial fetch | At least one page succeeds but pagination incomplete | stays `active`; process available messages; add warning |
| Full success | All pages fetched without error, ≥1 message processed | stays / returns to `active` |

**Recovery from `degraded`**: State returns to `active` automatically when Step 1 completes with a Full success or Partial fetch result on a subsequent run. Transport/auth failures do not recover automatically — they require the underlying MCP issue to be resolved.

### Step 2 (MODIFIED): Build Search Strategy

Driven by `dept-profile`:
- `primary_domain` + `secondary_domains` + `freeform_context` → determines direct-fetch sources and base queries
- `tracking.competitors/products` → targeted search queries (one per entity with score ≥ `signal_rules.query_entity_score_threshold`)
- `topic_weights` → topics with weight ≥ `signal_rules.high_weight_query_threshold` get 2 queries; between `low_weight_query_threshold` and `high_weight_query_threshold` get 1; below `low_weight_query_threshold` are skipped
- `sources.direct` → fetched directly each run
- `sources.search_queries` → used as seed queries; AI may augment

### Step 3 (MODIFIED): Filter and Process

- AI assigns domain-specific tags to each article based on `dept-profile`
- Tags map to the existing `tags` field in the JSON payload
- `render_daily.py` is **not modified** — domain grouping is expressed through tags on cards, not sidebar structure
- Example tags for `product` domain: `#竞品动态`, `#行业趋势`, `#工具更新`, `#用户研究`

### Step 4: JSON → HTML (unchanged)

- `render_daily.py` called as-is
- The JSON payload includes `digest_meta.warnings[]` for any runtime issues; **the renderer does not need to display these** — they are for logging and future tooling

### Step 5 (NEW): Update Profile History

- Extract today's top 3 topics from the generated digest
- Summarize group signals in 1–3 short strings
- Append/overwrite today's entry in `history` (last-write-wins)
- Trim to last 7 calendar days

---

## Feedback Signal Integration

The existing `data/feedback/` HTML behavior data is **preserved** as a secondary signal:

1. Feishu group chat signals (primary — team behavior)
2. HTML page feedback (secondary — individual reading behavior)
3. `dept-profile.yaml` static configuration (baseline)

---

## Fallback / Degradation Handling

| Failure Scenario | State Transition | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Group chat returns 0 messages (quiet day) | stays `active` | Apply decay only; no warning needed |
| `feishu_im_user_get_messages` transport/auth fails | → `degraded` | Add to `digest_meta.warnings[]`; use current profile; manual MCP fix required |
| Partial fetch (pagination incomplete) | stays `active` | Process available messages; add warning to `digest_meta.warnings[]` |
| Step 1 Full success while in `degraded` | → `active` | Automatic recovery |
| `feishu_group_id` not set | stays `awaiting_group_id` | Prompt user; exit without generating digest |
| KB read fails entirely (init) | stays `uninitialized` | Exit with error; prompt user to check MCP |
| Individual KB pages fail (init) | — | Skip those pages; log in `kb_init.init_coverage_note` |
| KB has <3 readable pages | → `awaiting_group_id` | Generate minimal profile with `primary_domain: general`; prompt to confirm |
| `primary_domain` empty after init | → `awaiting_group_id` | Prompt user to confirm domain via `/ai-daily set-domain <domain>` |
| Legacy `config/profile.yaml` found | → `awaiting_group_id` | Migrate; rename old file `.bak`; prompt for group ID |

---

## What Changes in SKILL.md

| Current | After |
|---|---|
| `config/profile.yaml` — manually filled | `config/dept-profile.yaml` — auto-generated via KB + daily group chat updates |
| Searches fixed to AI domain | Search strategy driven by dept profile (`primary_domain` + `tracking` + `topic_weights`) |
| Feedback via HTML page behavior only | Primary: Feishu group chat signals; secondary: HTML feedback |
| Tags are AI-specific (`#Agent`, `#开源`) | Tags are domain-specific, inferred per run from dept profile |
| Static profile | Profile drifts daily via signal boost/decay |
| Fixed AI sources | Sources derived from domain + `freeform_context` |
| Single execution path | Three path families: init / daily digest / control commands |

---

## Out of Scope

- Multi-department support in a single deployment
- Automatic Feishu group ID discovery
- Modifications to `render_daily.py` HTML structure or sidebar layout
- Feishu MCP server setup
- Schema migration beyond v1
- Displaying `digest_meta.warnings[]` in the HTML UI (warnings are for logging only)
